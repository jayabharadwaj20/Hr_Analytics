Welcome to the HR Analytics Project! This initiative addresses the critical issue of high employee turnover rates by utilizing advanced data analytics tools and techniques. Our primary objective was to conduct an in-depth analysis of HR data to identify key factors influencing employee attrition and implement data-driven interventions to mitigate this challenge. We used Power BI, Tableau, Excel, and MySQL to manage and analyze the datasets. The process involved collecting and cleaning HR data using Power Query Editor, followed by analyzing and modeling with Power Pivot to establish robust data relationships. Interactive dashboards were created in Power BI, Tableau, and Excel, featuring various charts, filters, and slicers for effective data summarization. Based on our analysis, we designed and implemented targeted interventions to address the identified attrition factors and continuously monitored their impact to ensure sustained improvements. The project revealed significant data patterns and historical trends, which informed the development of effective business strategies. These insights have been crucial in reducing employee turnover and fostering a more stable and engaged workforce.
